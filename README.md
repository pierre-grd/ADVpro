# Presentation of the project

## Abstract

At each turn, the player will have to make choices for his island. 
He has four possibilities: 
- He can decide to defend his island against the opponent's attack.
  - Keys "d" or "right"
- He can decide to attack the opponent.
  - Keys "a" or "left"
- He can decide to invest on his island's defense structure.
  - Keys "s" or "down"
- He can decide to invest on his island's attack materials. 
  - Keys "w" or "up"

The player (red) on the right side of the screen has the keys "up", "down", "left" and "right". <br>
